Hello, I choose to make a clean archtecure for this project. I choose to separate the project in modules.

Domain have all the core business and provide the core use cases
Data implements the domain use cases
Infra implements the Data layer dependencies
Presenter layer is responsable to make the view smart
UI Layar is 
Main layer is responsable to get the concrete use cases

I didn't finish the Main and UI layer, I worked using TDD in Domain, Data and Infra layers and maybe this taked more time.

The TODO list is:

Finish the UI layer
Make localizations
Use the correct fonts
Make Integrations tests using XCUITests
Improove the usability

That's it, ENJOY!! <3
